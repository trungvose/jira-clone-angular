# Welcome to Angular Jira Clone Storybook

## What is Storybook

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

## What is Angular Jira Clone Storybook

This is the collection of components that I wrote for [jira.trungk18.com][jira], includes

- Avatar
- Breadcrumbs
- Button
- Input
- More to come...

## What is Angular Jira Clone

There have been a handful of cool Jira-cloned apps written in `React`/`VueJS`, which makes me wonder **Why not Angular**? And here you go.
This is not only a simplified Jira clone built with Angular, but also an example of a **modern**, **real-world** Angular codebase.

## Tutorial

When I look at the application, it is huge. When the task is huge, you usually don't know where and how to start working with them. I started to break the big task into a [simple to-do list on notion][todo-list]. Once I know what needs to be done, what I need is to follow the plan. That's my approach.

I learned a lot of stuff. I know you might also have a curiosity about the process of building the same scale app as well. That's why I am writing a tutorial series on how I built Angular Jira clone from scratch. I hope you guys will learn something from that too :)

I will try to be as detailed as possible. Hopefully through the tutorial, you will get the idea and will start working on your own application soon. Please bear with me.

Its series will also be published in Vietnamese as part of our [angular-vietnam/100-days-of-angular][100days].
